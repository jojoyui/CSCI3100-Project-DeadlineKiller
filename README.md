## CSCI3100 Project - DeadlineKiller
CSCI3100 Software Enigeering (Spring 2020) Group Project: DeadlineKiller


This software is created by the CSCI3100 students who studied in 2021 semester 2, we are Group B4 of the class. Our project, Deadline killer aims at solving the utmost concern of university students, procrastination on any given task. Hopefully with this tool, students are more capable to manage their work with clear visualisation and ahead notice on deadlines, hence minimizing the number of deadline fighters in universities.
